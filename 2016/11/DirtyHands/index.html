    <p class="post-content"><p>flicked on the radio heard the<br>old man tell me<br>everything’s gonna be alright and<br>I found that real funny since<br>my nana’s about<br>his age and she’s all<br>ash I caught her blowing in the wind once which was<br>real funny since I<br>put her in the ground myself</p>
<p>it’s too bad I was<br>also dead at the time otherwise I<br>coulda carried a lot more weight and<br>I woulda had a good excuse to cry I<br>never did that back then on account of<br>I was stone dead too</p>
<p>there must’ve been something in me cuz<br>I was eating a lot and<br>my bloodstream was a pharmacy and<br>I could feel my heart beating but<br>my head ran cool and I<br>didn’t feel I<br>just watched</p>
<p>I was in the ground when I woke up<br>real funny how much<br>dirt you get in your fingernails<br>trying to dig yourself out<br>I see it even now and my<br>best friend used to tell me that<br>she wasn’t supposed to trust boys with<br>dirt under their fingernails it would<br>means he’s unclean and<br>I always figured she was right but<br>now I know</p>
<p>I stopped washing my hands a while ago<br>but you never really know when you’re done<br>there was this spot that I<br>couldn’t get rid of<br>no matter how hard I tried<br>seems to be gone now<br>not quite sure where I left it</p>
