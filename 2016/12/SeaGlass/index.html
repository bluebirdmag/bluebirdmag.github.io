    <p class="post-content"><p>If you could get close enough, the rubber souls of their boots crunching against the sand screamed like a billion teeth grinding together. But from up where they were their steps only sounded like pat, pat, pat, pat.<br>“Do you think it will rain again?” she asked him.<br>“Darling, pick your feet up.”<br>“I’m sorry you’re right,” she said.<br>Pat, pat, pat, pat.<br>“She looks lonely up there. You know she told me she was lonely. Anyway, I should say she’s lonely.”<br>“Of course she is,” the girl said, “How long has it been since he left her for that little slut?”<br>“Don’t be obscene.”<br>“I’m sorry,” the girl said, looking down at her feet.<br>“It was years ago. And then I left her for you.”<br>“That’s not the same, you’re her son!” cried the girl. Then suddenly realizing how loud she had spoken, she bent down and picked up a piece of sea glass from the beach, and looked up slowly to the woman walking alone ahead of them. She did not hear. Relieved, the girl stood up and held the glass up to her eye between her thumb and index finger, and her other hand reached out for her lover.<br>“I’d like to find a rarer colour,” she said as they continued to stroll down the shore. Pat, pat, pat, pat.<br>“Darling, put that down, it’s just a stone.”<br>“You’re right,” she sighed, and bent down to drop it, but as he looked away she slipped it into her pocket. And as they walked she turned it over in her hand inside the pocket. It’s clear glass, she thought, maybe from an old beer bottle or a jar. She rolled it around again, touching every inch of its smooth, frosted surface. She imagined it came from the window of a wrecked ship and that she held the last surviving bit of an old, ruined thing.</p>
<p>Ahead on the beach, the mother walked alone. Her short blonde hair blew in the wind and she saw the grey clouds beginning to form over the water and start to roll inland. She stumbled lazily, bullied by the coming storm. She wore a thick black overcoat but it was not enough to keep the wind from piercing through to her skin. Maybe way up in the air you could feel the clouds condensing. But down where she was, she had a sharp piece of jagged blue sea glass in her coat pocket and as she played with it, it cut into her fingers and the palm of her hand. She figured she would keep it to give to her son and his lover. She imagined it came from a poison bottle, and that Romeo had drunk from it before casting it into the sea and dying, falsely bereaved. She would give it to her son as a reminder, that things do not always end forever. She held her head up and strolled confidently down the beach, proudly gripping the glass in her pocket, enduring the pain. As she reached the end of the beach she stopped dead and dropped to her knees. The rain began to fall and the rumbling of thunder could be heard off in the distance. Her son and his lover strolled along obliviously some ways behind her. And she began to weep. She wiped her eyes and looked up again in despair, before her was an old, indiscernible sign, and someone has scrawled three words in black paint over the blank placard: </p>
