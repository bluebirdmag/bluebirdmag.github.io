    <p class="post-content"><p>ZEDD technologies is a start-up in a small market, putting it in a financial standing that differs from other firms in the industry.<br>ZEDD has a return on sales that is significantly higher than the industry average, resulting from the nature of the product and size of the company. Externally, this is from having a niche product where they can charge higher prices than in a more competitive market. In addition, the company’s small size creates few inefficiencies that minimize operational costs. As ZEDD grows and competition enters the market, the return on sales will likely shrink in the future.<br>Although ZEDD’s start-up nature reduces operational inefficiencies, the company’s small size is a factor in its return on assets being lower than industry norms. Being a start-up, basics like office space and materials make up a majority of company expenses. These assets are necessities of any business, but don’t directly improve sales. In the future ZEDD should invest in assets that directly improve sales in order to increase its return on assets, bringing it closer to industry averages.<br>Given that much of ZEDD’s current financing comes from government agencies and programs, the cofounders have been able to retain more equity than if it were funded by creditors. This results in the company having an equity ratio that is much higher than the industry average. Further on, ZEDD will likely have to reduce owner’s equity in order to gain the capital to expand, causing the equity ratio to fall.<br>Once again, the start-up nature of ZEDD is able to explain the large differences in its quick and current ratios from industry. Since the company is starting out, it is in a stage of constant growth by entering debt to generate basic assets. This quick growth requires that most of ZEDD’s assets to be liquid, explaining why its quick ratio is higher than average in the industry. Having a current ratio of just over 1 shows that the company is capable of paying back its liabilities, but should exercise caution to ensure that its investments will create assets of greater worth. While ZEDD continues to grow, its current ratio will rise and its quick ratio will fall as it shifts from liquid to non-liquid assets.<br>Since it is a company with a relatively small and consistent sales forecast, ZEDD is able to manage its production well. Having a high inventory turnover is important for a start-up in order to get faster returns on its manufacturing costs. Given that ZEDD’s inventory turnover ratio is higher than industry averages, it is implied that ZEDD has been effective in managing its inventory and production thus far. Moving forward, it is important that ZEDD maintain production levels at a reasonable rate relative to its sales forecasts.<br>In conclusion, it can be said that ZEDD technologies is in sound financial health given its current position. As the company grows, essentially all of its financial ratios can be expected to shift towards industry norms. To grow healthily, it is important that ZEDD set up barriers to entry to maintain their high return on sales. In doing this, they can continue to convert short-term liquid assets into long-term assets that directly improve sales &amp; drive profit. Meanwhile, they should be certain to make safe investments and not overestimate their sales forecasts. </p>
