    <p class="post-content"><p><em>“Sweet is the death that taketh end by love” – Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey</em></p>
<p>“I suppose I should go for some food.” said McTavish to his wife.<br>Without waiting for her to reply he picked up the flare gun and emergency rifle provided by his pilot and snuck off into the orange and brown dust.<br>Mrs. McTavish lay by their fire, propped up against the rocks and makeshift shelter her husband had built from wood, vines and scrap metal. They were stationed in the middle of the vast and endless grassland, under the single baobab tree that was visible to the horizon in every direction. Yellow patches of grass sprouted from the ground on the flat, blank, dirt canvas of the savanna. The plain stretched for miles across the earth.<br>Mrs. McTavish had many bruises and cuts and now she could not move. She just lay by the fire, not moving or speaking. Her skin was losing its colour with the infection but her body was rigid and strong. Her dark hair was turning gray and falling out. She had not eaten in a week although her husband had offered her food, so her body was becoming thin. Her ribcage began to show. Her face was pretty but fragile. She didn’t have much to do or think about anymore so she lay still by the fire.<br>Many hours later her husband returned. He had slain a Gazelle and began to skin and clean it poorly. He hacked at the raw meat until there were few useable parts.</p>
<p>“Lovely meat my dear. A shame I had to kill it but we must eat.” McTavish said to his wife, “how do you like your meat?”</p>
<p>She didn’t reply because she couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Ah rare, the way I like it. It’s such a shame, such a damn shame. Isn’t death such a shame?”</p>
<p>He poked through a chunk of meat with a stick he had sharpened and held it over the fire.</p>
<p>“How long has it been since we made love my dear?” he asked her, “you still love me don’t you?”</p>
<p>The meat began to turn brown and he twisted the stick a quarter turn. He twirled the end of his thick, black mustache. It was longer now than it had been since the accident and the hair on the rest of his face was growing where he usually shaved. His once neat hair had grown too and he had no pomade to slick it back with so it fell in his eyes. He was shirtless and shoeless. He lost both in the crash. He was injured as well, though not as badly as his wife so he did the hunting. There was a large gash in his right forearm, exposing his thick red muscles but he had bandaged it and that had held it together well. Pain is just in the mind after all.</p>
<p>“I still love you dear.” He said, “like the day I fell in love with you. How we used to dance in those days. We haven’t danced like that since Paris— You know, we have all the time in the world right now. Will you dance with me my dear?”</p>
<p>Without awaiting her response he laid the stick and meat over the fire so it would roast slowly, went to her and picked her up from the dust. They began to waltz across the campsite. He closed his eyes and inhaled through his nose. Suddenly he was in Paris again, in the ballroom. Each step pattered softly on the creaky floor.</p>
<p>“And one-two-three, one-two-three, one-two-three there you go love, you’ve got it!” McTavish said excitedly.</p>
<p>His fine tailored suit caressed his wife’s red ball gown. He could smell the champagne and cigar smoke. They twirled and stepped, twirled and stepped.</p>
<p>“One-two-three, one-two-three, one-two-three.”</p>
<p>Couples started to join them dancing and all together they twirled and stepped. Candles burned on the piano and wax melted and dripped on the black polish. In the crowd McTavish’s friends smiled at him and laughed. They all stayed through the night, drinking and smiling and dancing.</p>
<p>“One-two-three, one-two-three, one-two-three.”</p>
<p><em>“Here’s to my love. [He drinks.] O true apothecary<br>Thy drugs are quick. Thus, with a kiss, I die” – William Shakespeare 5.3.119-120</em></p>
<p>The crackle of the fire and the snapping of a burning log snatched McTavish from his fantasy and he was back in the grassland. He shrugged and lay down beside the fire with his wife. He stared into her eyes and kissed her softly on the lips.</p>
<p>“That was fun love and I miss doing things like that with you. I will love you forever. As long as I have you I don’t mind this so much.”</p>
<p>He kissed her again, heavier and longer this time and laid his hands on her hips. They made love that night as the sun set on them across the endless plain. The meat burned and fat dripped onto the burning logs.<br>The next few weeks were the same. He hunted and she watched the campsite, all the while growing colder from her infection. He piled the unused parts of the five Gazelles he had slain beside his wife and their skin began to lose colour and smell. It became harder for McTavish to find food because he had wasted so much of the animal and thrown it carelessly into the pile. He began to return to the campsite later and later each night.<br>One night he returned after dark with no food and found that his wife had let the fire go out in her sleep.</p>
<p>“I mustn’t wake her,” he said to himself, “I will skin what is left from yesterdays hunt and start a fire in the morning.”</p>
<p>So once more he carelessly skinned the animal and left the chunks of red meat beside the fire. When he woke in the morning his wife was gone. All that was left of her corpse were a few bones and the useless parts of her body.<br>It had been a month since their bush plane went down on the savanna, killing the pilot and McTavish’s wife. McTavish had not yet come to accept that he was running out of meat.</p>
